<h4>Kindergarten: The Making of a short</h4>
<p> The first task in the making of this short was watching all of the footage and deciding what clips to use. This was a daunting task with nearly 40 clips of footage ranging from 7 seconds to 18 seconds. After completing this task, I narrowed it down to 18 possible clips. Being that these clips did  not tie into one another aside from their setting and characters, I watched repeatedly looking for commonalities in an effort to create a story.</p>

<p>Once I found a theme I decided that the audio did not benefit the concept I had in mind and I therefore removed the audio track. After doing so silent films immediately came to mind and I decided on that route removing the color as well and leaving only shades of black and white. In an effort to give it more of a silent film aestetic, in addition to the shades, I aquired an old film countdown reel to begin the short.</p>
<p>Finally I edited the clips down to tell the stories I had in mind. The most difficult part for me was "freezing" the frames. Zooming in at key moments for dramatic and comical effect was the final step in my process.</p>
