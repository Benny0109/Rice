	<p>I love children, and have made them my life's work! Hi, I'm Benny, a proud Brooklyn native with carribean roots. I grew up in Williamsburg where I attending elementary school and middle school. I learned ASL in High School in Downtown Brooklyn and taught my daughter three languages during her first year of life. I believe that children are capable of anything with the proper support.</p>

    <p>I take pride in all that I do and do so with passion. My main passion is building a better tomorrow by focusing today on our youth. I am doing so through compassion, patience, respect and ultimately, psychology. My passion for psychology, children and helping others have led me to my position. Whether I am at work or not, if a child is in need I will do what I can to aid them, it  makes me happy.</p>

    <p>Currently I work for the Department of Education with special needs children in an underprivilidged neighborhood where a lack of basic needs are not met. As a result the children I service are in great need of mental health services if not now in the near future. I intend to service this community on a greater scale with my degree in Child Psychology. In the meantime, I make the most of the knowledge I have and gain daily in the classroom.</p>
