			<p>Too often parents do as doctors say without ever questioning it because we are not experts in that field, but we should be experts in advocating for our own children. I am not here to tell anyone what they should do, but rather to provide information that may offer options where we may not neccessarily see them. </p>

<p>In the first year of our childs life the CDC schedule has 25 shots lined up for your baby during the first 15 months, including the controversial MMR vaccine. If you are not familiar with this vaccine, it is the vaccine many parents of children with ASD (Autism Spectrum Disorder) believe is responsible for causing the disorder. Some doctors, like recommend that this vaccine be administered after age 3 and not at the CDC's recommended 12-15 months of age. The three in one vaccine used to be offered as 3 individual shots but the CDC took that option off the table and parents are now forced to have their infants receive them all at once. </p>

<p>Are parents aware of the ingredients being injected into our infants? We should be, but too many are not. If we knew, would we choose to continue to allow this? Maybe, but we should be making an informed decision not a blind one. Pregnant women are strongly advised not to consume raw fish during pregnancy in an effort to avoid consuming mercury as it could be harmful to the fetus. Yet, thimerosal, a mercury based preservative is routinely used in vaccines including some variations of the flu shot.</p>
